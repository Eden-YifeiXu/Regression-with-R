The purpose of this project is to focus on supervised modeling with <b>Multiple Regression</b>. In particular, I will build model with diagnostics and optimization to neither underfit nor overfit the data. I will describe and discover structure in a wrangled project dataset, train and validate my best model, and interpret it in a professional quality report. For each significant step, I will document results, interpretations, and process. In writing the report, I will consider business tradeoffs, articulate my assumptions, and consider the broader business/government context.
